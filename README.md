# React SPA for OpenAI Realtime API Voice Interaction

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite. It allows users to interact with the OpenAI Realtime API for speech input/output. The app sends transcribed text to a backend, which will later connect to an MCP server for semantic search and further processing.

## Features
- Voice input and output using OpenAI Realtime API
- Sends transcribed text to a backend for processing
- Receives and plays spoken responses from the backend
- Ready for integration with MCP server and further backend logic

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
	```bash
	npm install
	```
2. Start the development server:
	```bash
	npm run dev
	```

## Next Steps
- Implement frontend logic for voice interaction
- Set up backend API endpoints
- Integrate MCP server for semantic search
